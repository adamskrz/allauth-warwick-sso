# allauth-warwick-sso
University of Warwick OAuth provider for django-allauth

As explained at https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sign-on/help/oauth/apis/

Originally written for https://github.com/WarwickStudentArtsFestival/WSAF-Management, this is just the Django app folder. When I get some time I'll test it more, package it as a library, and maybe push to PyPi so it doesn't need adding to Django projects by hand.
